# Arduino_Automated_Greenhouse
Arduino Automated Greenhouse Developed as an agricultural engineering control project in 2022.

This project consisted of a script that measures relative humidity, temperature and sunlight, and makes decisions about actuators (fans and lights) based on thermal and water comfort ranges for vegetable garden species.

The greenhouse interacts with an application built with the MIT App Inventor environment, from the application the atmospheric variables could be monitored in real time and the actuators could be turned on. The application was connected to Google's FireBase service, this allows statistical monitoring of the crop.

The project is not functional at present, I put it in this repository to inspire and contribute to similar projects, the hardware was disassembled and I stopped maintaining the database.

This proyect included all the mechanical and software conception. It was my first scale model of automated controlled environments.
